     *   AUTHENTICATION SETUP
     * 
     *   In order to successfully execute any of the methods in this file
     *   one must first obtain an API Key and API Secret from ShipStation.
     *   This can be done by creating an account with ShipStation.
     *   
     *   Once you have your Key and Secret create two environment
     *   variables:
     * 
     *   SSAPIKey='yourShipStationAPIKey'
     *   SSAPISecret='yourShipStationSecret'
     * 
     *   NOTE: NEVER ADD YOUR API KEY OR SECRET DIRECTLY TO THIS SCRIPT
     *   SECURITY BEST PRACTICES REQUIRE THAT YOU USE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
     * 
     *   The authString property formats an authString as specified in the 
     *   ShipStation documentation: 
     * 
     *   https://www.shipstation.com/docs/api/requirements/
     *

     *   GET METHOD
     * 
     *   The get method gets data from the shipStationAPI and makes it
     *   available for use in a callback function which can be provided
     *   as an argument.
     * 
     *   @param {string} endpoint - the endpoint argument is the endpoint
     *   of the shipstation API that you wish to retrieve data from. 
     *   (ex: 'orders', 'shipments', 'products', etc)
     *   
     *   @param {object} filter - the filter argument is a set of one or
     *   more filters formatted as an object; where the filter name is
     *   the object property and the property value is the filter value.
     *   (ex: var filterObject = {orderID: 123, storedId: 123} )
     * 
     *   @param {function} cb - the cb argument is a callback function
     *   that takes the data returned from the ShipStation API as a
     *   parsed JSON object.
     *   (ex: var callback = function(data){ console.log(data) } )
     *
